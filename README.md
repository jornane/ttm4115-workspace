TTM4115 Term Assignment
=======================
Group number XX

This project contains some basic GUI classes for the TTM4115 Term Assignment.
Students are encouraged to use this project as a starting point for the term assignment, adding functionality required in the project description and changing the provided classes for extra credit.
Students are encouraged to replace this README file with their own.

The project is available both on ReactiveBlocks ([no.ntnu.item.ttm4115.termassignment](http://blocks.bitreactive.com/#/library/_NuSVsKOdEeOlvM2Rtrpuog/2.2.0)) and GitHub ([yorn/ttm4115-workspace](https://github.com/yorn/ttm4115-workspace)).
Students are free to choose where to obtain the project.

As-is, the project contains two GUIs, `TaxiClientGUI` and `UserClientGUI`.
These GUIs are based on the generic `ClientGUI` class, which contains convenience methods for rapid GUI prototyping.
Students are not required to change the GUI, but they are encouraged to do so if they think they can improve something or add extra features.
Doing so may lead to extra credit being rewarded.
